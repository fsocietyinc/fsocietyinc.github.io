# maybe this is the year

It has been two years since my last post. In that time, goals were missed and this space sat quiet. 

For 2026, I’m moving away from grand resolutions and focusing on a single metric: **showing up.** Consistency has been the missing piece, and this post is the first step toward fixing that.

Happy New Year. Let's get to work.
